	<h1><span class="headline-lines">YOUR MENTOR</span></h1>
	<p>My name is Jim OKelly and I have built hundreds of applications over the years</p>
	<p>I am the #1 Ruby on Rails Mentor at <a href="//www.codementor.io/rubymentor">Codementor.io</a> and I have helped hundreds of students,
	entrepreneurs, and developers build their applications, solve their problems, and learn
	some skills for the digital age.</p>
	<p>I started web programming using HTML back in the mid 90s, creating terrible, ugly,
	"web pages" on GeoCities back when Hootie and The Blowfish where all the rage and
	guys my age spent 90% of their time huddled around Warcraft2 games at Internet cafes.</p>

	<p class="headline-text">I am also the "No Bullshit"&trade; Ruby Mentor</p>
	<p>Regardless of the gimmicks and marketing say, learning to be a real web developer in three months is bullshit, no matter how hard you work.
	You have to put in the time and effort yourself. The GOOD NEWS is you CAN be accelerated by working with a master developer who has already
	fought the hard battles.</p>
	<p>I have been there, I have clawed my way up and stayed on top. Without a high school diploma or a college degree I have been employed by some
	of the top tech companies and I have beaten MIT grads out of many jobs with just my ability to communicate with business people and provide
	real, uncomplicated solutions.</p>
	<p>My goal is not just to make you a good developer, but to be able to think like a business person. You will learn how to write idiomatic
	code, but you will also learn how to only code the shit that matters, and the only shit that matters is does it make money - yes or no.</p>
	<p>Also with me, your education will be built on evidence and science, not political correctness or some tired shitty curriculum built by
	a 2nd year bootcampee pretending to be an instructor.<p>
